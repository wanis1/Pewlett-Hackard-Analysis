# PEWLETT-HACKARD-ANALYSIS

## OVERVIEW
The purpose of this project is to analyse the data for employees that are eligible to retire. We first extracted the employee data for employees who are eligible to retire and then we determined the count of those employees under each title.

We also used the data to extract employee information for employees who are eligible for entorship program based on a specific criteria.

## RESULTS
- We created a retiring title table where we are able to see the count of employees holding each title that are eligible to retire.

- From the table "retiring_title", we can tell the majority of people retiring hold the senior title, and the title that has the lowest number of potential retirees is "Manager".
- This table is created based on the most recent titles held by the employees.
- In the second part of this analysis, we extracted and compiled employee information for the current employees eligible for mentorship program based on the criteria that there birth year is 1965
